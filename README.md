My [streamlit application](https://allisonc4321-streamlit-app-app-5nznsc.streamlit.app/) helps with creating a exploratory data analysis for the csv dataset selected.

It consists of the following tools

1. Provides the general information on the dataset
    a. The number of rows and columns are given
    b. Column types are also listed
2. If the Numerical data type is selected, columns of data types int64 and float64 can be graphed as a histogram
3. If the Categorical data type is selected, columns of data type object can be graphed as a bar plot
4. For graphing, the following are customizable
    a. Color opacity
    b. Number of bins (for histograms)
    c. Graph titles and x-axis labels
